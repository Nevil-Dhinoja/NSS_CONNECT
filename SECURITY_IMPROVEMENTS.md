# Security Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document outlines all security improvements made to the NSS CHARUSAT project to prevent data leaks and enhance overall security.

## Client-Side Improvements

### 1. Console Log Removal
- **Files Modified**: `client/src/MainPart/LoginPage.jsx`
- **Changes**: Removed all `console.log` and `console.error` statements
- **Impact**: Prevents sensitive information from being logged to browser console

### 2. Environment Variables Implementation
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `client/src/MainPart/LoginPage.jsx`
  - `client/src/MainPart/EventPage.jsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Replaced hardcoded dashboard URL with `process.env.REACT_APP_DASHBOARD_URL`
  - Replaced hardcoded Google Drive link with `process.env.REACT_APP_DRIVE_LINK`
- **Impact**: Prevents hardcoded URLs from being exposed in source code

### 3. CSS Security and Performance
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `client/src/components/style.css`
  - `client/src/MainPart/MainPart.css`
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed modal positioning to prevent overlay issues
  - Improved responsive design for better security on mobile
  - Optimized CSS for performance and accessibility
  - Removed redundant styles and consolidated media queries

## Server-Side Improvements

### 1. JWT Secret Security
- **Files Modified**: `server/routes/auth.js`
- **Changes**: Updated default JWT secret to be more secure
- **Impact**: Better security for token generation

### 2. Email Password Security
- **Files Modified**: `server/services/emailService.js`
- **Changes**: Removed hardcoded email password
- **Impact**: Prevents email credentials from being exposed in source code

## Environment Variables Required

### Client (.env file in client directory)
```env
REACT_APP_DASHBOARD_URL=http://172.16.11.213:8080/
REACT_APP_DRIVE_LINK=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zbPXPL_5Eh6O0j4-vXirgdYDpAgVHX0T
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://172.16.11.213:5000/api
```

### Server (.env file in server directory)
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FRONTEND_URL=http://172.16.11.213:3000
```

- Proper fallback values for development

### 2. Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- Client-side validation for better UX
- SQL injection prevention

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Token verification middleware

- Graceful error handling

### 5. File Security
- Secure file upload handling
- File type validation
- Proper file storage

## Recommendations for Production

### 1. Environment Variables
- Use strong, unique secrets for production
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use different secrets for different environments

### 2. HTTPS
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Use secure cookies
- Implement HSTS

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Prevent brute force attacks
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### 4. Logging
- Implement proper logging
- Monitor for security events
- Regular security audits

### 5. Updates
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular security patches
- Monitor for vulnerabilities

## Files Modified

### Client
- `client/src/MainPart/LoginPage.jsx`
- `client/src/MainPart/EventPage.jsx`
